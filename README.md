## 🔎 Executive Summary  
Provide a concise summary of your project. Highlight the problem you solved, your methodology, and the key insights or results. Keep this section short but impactful to grab attention.  

---

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Describe the business problem or analytical challenge that motivated the project. Make it relatable to real-world scenarios or industry needs.  

*Example:*  
Customer churn poses a significant risk to subscription-based businesses. Understanding why customers leave and predicting who is at risk enables proactive retention strategies.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clearly state what you set out to achieve.  
- Mention the analytical or business goals.  

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated  
- **Programming & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), R, SQL  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Power BI  
- **Modeling & Statistics:** Regression, Classification, Clustering, Hypothesis Testing  
- **Workflow Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub, Excel  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Sourcing and preparing the dataset.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies.  
3. **Visualization** – Creating charts and dashboards to communicate findings.  
4. **Modeling / Hypothesis Testing** – Applying analytical or predictive techniques.  
5. **Insights & Recommendations** – Translating results into actionable outcomes.  

---

## 📥 Data Sourcing  
- Explain **where and how** you obtained the dataset (public datasets, APIs, surveys, Kaggle, government portals, simulated data, etc.).  
- Describe any data transformation performed before analysis.  

*Example:*  
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle’s Telco Customer Churn dataset. Additional demographic data was scraped from open census APIs to enrich the analysis. Raw data contained 7,043 customer records with 21 features.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Model Formation  
- Outline **how you structured the dataset** for analysis/modeling.  
- Mention feature engineering, variable selection, or data schema design.  
- If you built a predictive/statistical model, describe the logic.

<img src="./images/semantic_model_real.png" />

*Example:*  
I developed a classification model where the **target variable** was `Churn` (Yes/No).  
- Categorical variables were encoded using One-Hot Encoding.  
- Continuous variables were standardized.  
- Missing values were imputed using median values.  
- Final dataset contained 35 engineered features, which were fed into Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for prediction.  


## 📈 Key Results & Insights  
- List 3–5 top findings from your analysis.  
- Present insights in clear, recruiter-friendly language.  
- Use visuals (charts, screenshots) if possible.  

---

## 💡 What I Learned  
- Point out new technical or analytical skills you gained.  
- Highlight soft skills like communication or problem framing.  
- Show reflection and growth from the project.  

---

## ✅ Best Approach (My Perspective)  
Briefly describe what you believe is the **most effective way to solve the problem** if you had more resources or time.  

*Example:*  
While the logistic regression model provided decent accuracy, I believe combining it with ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, alongside deeper feature engineering, would yield stronger predictive performance.

📌 Next Steps

## Challenges I faced
1. Data source: Different excel format and sheets
2. Different tags names
3. Extracting the year from the frames
4. Testing for valid frames
Mention how you could extend or improve the project.

Suggest deployment, real-time analysis, or dashboard enhancements.

## 🔜 My Next Project

### Divvy Bike-Sharing Riding Pattern
My next project will focus on determing consumer pattern for a bike-sharing company. The marketing team wants to understand how the two subscribers (casual and member) use the service. The team has proposed that converting more casuals into members will increase revenue significantly. This next project will aim at stating the riding patterns of casual and members and how to convert casual to member.
